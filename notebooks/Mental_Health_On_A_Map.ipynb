    "The state of good mental health in America is in steady decline. More and more Americans are getting depressed and / or suffer from various mental health disorders such as addiction, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Poor mental health not only affects the lives of the patients, but also the patients' families and loved ones which spirals into a domino effect that causes the emergence of a mentally moribund society. One of the most dangerous effects of poor mental health is the attempt to commit suicide. I believe that it's time to not depend solely on appointments at insured hospitals for mental health consultations, but to actually increase the possible mental health support through a personalized network. In this project, I use a geospatial information systems (GIS) and a cognitive intelligence solution to help patients navigate their mental health by doing nothing more than just simply going about their lives and let the heavy lifting be done by advances in technology. I was inspired to do this project after hearing that a Harvey Mudd student committed suicide in the late summer of this year, 2018.\n",

    "This part of the project is about completing 3 objectives through an initial exploration of the data conducted in Python data science stack: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To build an efficient search strategy to find as many mental health services in the Inland Empire as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To understand the scope of mental health services in the Inland Empire. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. If possible, seeing the relationship of number of suicides in Inland Empire to its clusters of mental health services. \n",

    "At first I had to think about what kind of mental health support services are out there. Clearly, hospitals with psychotherapy services cannot be the only kinds of mental health support since many hospitals also have an outpatient network to deal with increasing demand, but are not always disclosed to the patient. Finding the mental health support structures that are available to the public required the use of the North American Industry Classification System which has codes for several categories of businesses throughout the United States. I used the following codes for my search: \n",
    "\n",
    "* 621330: Social workers' mental health offices (centers and clinics)\n",
    "* 621140: Mental health centers and clinics (except hospitals), outpatient\n",
    "* 622210: Mental health hospitals \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding these NAICS codes, I used referenceusa.com (Thanks to Dr. Brian Hilton) in order to accurately search for all the mental health verifiable licensed business listings based on zip codes and these NAICS codes for the following cities in the Inland Empire:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Claremont\n",
    "* Fontana \n",
    "* Montclair\n",
    "* Ontario\n",
    "* Pomona\n",
    "* Rancho Cucamonga\n",
    "* San Bernardino \n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to obtain the data in form of the comma separated value files with highly detailed features, including geospatial information that can help put these businesses onto a map in ArcGIS and thus into a shapefile. Now get a better understanding of the data will be obtained below using the pandas package.\n"
